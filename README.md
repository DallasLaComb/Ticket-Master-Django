Developed a ticket browsing and bookmarking websit which utilizes the Ticketmaster API to dynamically fetch and display current tickets available for events. This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, Django, and SQLite for the database. Users can search for events, such as 'Music' in 'Hartford', and bookmark tickets of interest for later viewing on the bookmarks page.
